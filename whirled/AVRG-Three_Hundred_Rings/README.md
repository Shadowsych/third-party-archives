![Icon](rsrc/ring125x175.png)

Three Hundred Rings is an interactive clicking game for the website http://www.whirled.com/
The files are now open-source for anyone to study and utilize for future AVRG games in Whirled.

## Dependencies
You will need:
- Flex SDK (to build the files) 
  - http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html
- Adobe Flash or Notepad++ (to edit the actionscript codes) 
  - https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.2.2.html
  - http://www.adobe.com/products/animate.html

## Documentation and Setup
- Place the Three_Hundred_Rings folder (with the files inside the folder) into your whirled-sdk
- Run the Server.as file in a separate server building folder since the ActionScript file uses MovieClips in the .fla file
- Run the three_hundred_rings.fla file in Flash/Animate CC
- Now you will have both the .abc and .swf file if you followed the previous steps correctly, so upload those into Whirled
